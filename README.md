## Your favorite app developers are back at it again!
Me and [@kshriv](https://github.com/kshriv) finished up another year at GT and realized we had around a week before our internships started. With a time crunch of a week and a dream to change the world we decided to grind out an expense tracking app. Why an expense tracking app you may ask? With only a week we didn't want to set the bar too high but also not too low. With an expense tracking app we realized that it could be as detailed and comprehensive as we wanted it to be but also allow us to save features for future iterations of the app. 

## The Goal
At a high level we set a plan:

• Money management can be quite stressful, we wanted to alleviate the stress surrounding such a topic by creating a fun UI

• Implement data persistence in Swift

• Integrate cocoapods into our project

• Practice flat UI/UX design and create great animations

• Transition away from storyboarding designs and move towards a programmatic approach

• Create amazing graphs generated from user data

• Practice the MVC design method

## Data Persistence
After discussing different options to persist data, we decided the most logical as well as the the easiest would be to implement Apple's native User Defaults. This way the data is stored locally on your device and you don't have to have Wi-Fi or data to use the app. Since user defaults is essentially just a backend dictionary where data is stored by keys we made a key for every category we allotted as an expense option. Putting this in a struct allowed us to access the keys easily throughout any swift file. 




## Lottie Animations
Having animations on this app was very important to us as we wanted to be able to have an extremely user friendly and receptive UI. A great way to do this was through the [Lottie Animations Pod](https://lottiefiles.com/). The app immediately loads up with loading animation and the background of the home screen is painted with falling coins. It's practically impossible to not notice the animations scattered throughout the app.

## In Conclusion:
Creating (slaving) over this app was super fun. With a time crunch of a week we had to cut features out that we are pushing to future iterations of the app, but having a week and a dream made it a great project to pick up and spend my free time on. Download it now @ ...
